What is NativeBase?\n[NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/) is a free and open source framework that enables developers to build high-quality mobile apps using [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) iOS and Android apps with a fusion of [ES6](http://es6-features.org/#Constants). NativeBase builds a layer on top of React Native that provides you with basic set of components for mobile application development. This helps you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms. [Read More. . .](http://nativebase.io/documentation)\n\n\n\n## 2. Why NativeBase?\nWhat is really great with [NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/) is that you can use shared UI cross-platform components, which will drastically increase your productivity. When using NativeBase, you can use any native third-party libraries out of the box. You do not need to use wrappers or do any other actions. The new additions to the native platform are available immediately. NativeBase provides amazing support for adding components, so that you will by no means hit a lifeless stop.\n\n**Recommended by** *Microsoft*\n> If you're looking to get started with React Native + CodePush, and are looking for an awesome starter kit, you should check out Native Starter Pro - [Microsoft's react-native-code-push repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#example-apps--starters)\n\n**Recommended by [Awesome React Native](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native)**\n>NativeBase added into the list of [Frameworks](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native#frameworks) of Awesome React Native and are also used by many other React lovers across the world.\n\n\n## 4. Getting Started\n\n**System Requirements**\n\n* Globally installed [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 4.0\n\n* Globally installed [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) >= 3.0\n\n* Globally installed [rnpm](https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm) *(only if React Native version < 0.29)*\n\n* Globally installed [react-native CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)\n\n\n**Installation**\n\nTo have NativeBase components running onto your native apps, all you need to do is create a fresh [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) project and install the [NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/) command line tools.\n\n```\nreact-native init AwesomeNativeBase\n\ncd AwesomeNativeBase\n\nnpm install\n```\n\nInclude NativeBase into your React Native project.\n```\nnpm install native-base --save\n```\n\nNow you are ready to get going with NativeBase. [Read More. . .](http://nativebase.io/documentation)\n\n\n\n\n## 5. Components\n\n[NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/) is made from effective building blocks referred to as components. The Components are constructed in pure [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) platform along with some JavaScript functionality with rich set of customisable properties. These components allow you to quickly build the perfect interface.\n\nThe most awaited feature, **platform precise components** with single codebase is now available from the version 0.5.0 of NativeBase. Along with this, there comes in addition of set of **Fonts** to be readily integrated with your apps.
